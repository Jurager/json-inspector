// beside it — passes almost nothing: the desktop arrives flattened into the appearance's own panel,
// so the glass reads as a plain colour. Only these two carry it: .light for a light chrome and
// .hudWindow for a dark one, both of which keep the hues behind them, which is what acrylic does on
// Windows.
//
// .light is deprecated — the SDK points at the appearance property instead — but the appearance is
// exactly the lever that does NOT work here: a semantic material under a forced light appearance
// measured flatter still (a two-level spread where .light gives ten), so the deprecated constant is
// the one that behaves, and the warning is silenced above rather than worked around.
