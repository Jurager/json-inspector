// The version arrives from the build rather than from the source, so the one thing worth pinning
// here is that it always arrives: an empty version would reach the About window, the updater's
// comparison and the extension bridge's handshake as nothing at all.
//
// It is also how the injection is verified by hand, because a wrong symbol path in `-ldflags` fails
// silently — the linker does not warn, and the string still appears in the binary inside its
// recorded build settings. So the check is the value, not the build:
//
//	go test -v -ldflags "-X json-inspector/internal/platform.version=9.9.9" ./internal/platform/

// The identity is a constant and is never injected, which is the whole point of the split: a bundle
// identifier or a scheme that arrived empty would be a broken bundle, and no build may be able to
// produce one by forgetting a flag.
