// UpdateChannel is which releases the app is willing to be offered.

// wants one and a wrecked install for a user who does not — so the release source cannot pick.

// and read whole, which is why it is one value: the version, its notes and the time of the check
// are one fact — the answer to "what did we find" — and a half-written answer would have the window
// offering a version it cannot describe.
//
// It is not a preference and does not live with them (that half is Settings); both are kept in the
// same table, and the difference is which use case understands the value.

// unchanged — it has no reason to know that a version and its notes belong together, and splitting
// them would make a half-written state expressible.
