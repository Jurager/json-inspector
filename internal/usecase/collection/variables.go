// environments keep theirs in, a row with no name included. The «+» of the editor is what makes a
// row, and a store that dropped it on arrival would be a button doing nothing.
//
// A secret is refused here, and the refusal is the point: a collection is what gets exported,
// duplicated and handed to somebody else, and the export is the collection's own JSON. A value the
// window promises never to put in a DTO cannot live in a thing that leaves the machine. Secrets
// belong to the environment, which is where the sentence for this refusal sends the user.
