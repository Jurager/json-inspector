// The characters that separate the words of a pasted command. Three things ask, and they have to
// give the same answer: the tokenizer, the trimming every reader does, and the regexes that name
// the command in the first place.

// spaceRunes is that set by code point. It is not Go's unicode.IsSpace: a paste out of a browser
// carries U+FEFF, which separates tokens here, and it does not carry U+0085, which Go would treat
// as a space. The set is written as code points because a literal tab or non-breaking space in the
// source is invisible, and one of these characters being wrong would be invisible too.

// spaceInner is the set as the body of a regexp character class, and spaceClass wraps it for a
// positive class. Written as ranges rather than as `reClass` used to build it: the class is read by
// eye far more often than it is built, and `\x{2000}-\x{200A}` says "the spaces" where twenty-five
// escapes in a row say nothing.

// Headers and JSON keys keep the order they were written in. A JS object would enumerate a
// numeric-looking key first, whatever position it was written in, and an earlier version of this
// port reproduced that — but the order a request's headers go out in is the order somebody wrote
// them in. The corpus says nothing about the difference, so fixtures_test.go is where the rule is
// written down.
