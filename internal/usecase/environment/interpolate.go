// The `{{name}}` grammar: what a token is, which names are worth reading, and what a text comes to
// once the values are in it.

// It lives here because it is this feature's rule and nobody else's: a name names a variable of an
// environment, and "nothing came of it" means what blocks a send. The draft, which paints tokens as
// it draws an address field, asks through the port it declares for itself rather than reading the
// grammar — so what a token is stays in one place.
