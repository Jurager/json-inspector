// Package scriptengine runs a user's script in a sandbox: goja, the `pm` API, no network, no files,
// no timers, and a few seconds to finish.
//
// What a script can reach is the whole of its world: the request it is running around, the answer
// if there is one, and the three scopes its variables live in. There is no `pm.sendRequest`, and
// that is not a gap to be filled later — a script that could send a request would need a callback
// to come back through, and five seconds of sandbox would stop meaning anything.
