// What a script is given to work with. The time limit is the one that matters: there is no network
// and no timer inside the sandbox, so the only long call a script has can make is to itself, and an
// interruption is the only thing that can take a `while (true) {}` away from it.
//
// The rest are what keeps a runaway script from filling the report the tab draws. They are not a
// memory limit — goja has none, and the honest answer is that a script can allocate as much as the
// process can hold — they are a limit on what comes back out.

// limitScript stops a script that is still running when the time is up, and answers with the call that
// stops the timer — a run that finished in two milliseconds has no business leaving one armed.
//
// The interruption is not catchable from inside: a script cannot swallow its own deadline with
// try/catch, which is the whole reason this works.
